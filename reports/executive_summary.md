# Executive Summary — Metric Reconciliation & Dashboard Debugging

## Problem
Two internal dashboards (Finance and Growth) reported different revenue numbers for the same time periods, reducing trust in analytics and slowing decision-making.

## Findings
- 44% of analyzed days showed revenue mismatches
- Differences were driven by inconsistent metric definitions, filters, and data sources
- Both dashboards were internally consistent but answering different business questions

## Resolution
A canonical revenue metric was defined using payment data and consistent order filters, establishing a single source of truth for executive reporting.

## Outcome
- Restored confidence in revenue reporting
- Clear separation between financial and operational metrics
- Repeatable reconciliation process for future KPIs
