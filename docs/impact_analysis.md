# KPI Mismatch Impact Analysis

## Summary
Out of 614 total days analyzed:
- 273 days (~44%) showed revenue mismatches between Finance and Growth dashboards
- 340 days (~55%) matched
- 1 day had missing Finance data

This indicates that nearly half of reported business days would lead to conflicting conclusions depending on which dashboard leadership reviewed.

## Why This Matters
- Conflicting KPIs reduce trust in analytics
- Leadership decisions may be delayed or incorrect
- Teams optimize against different numbers

## Primary Drivers of Mismatch
1. Different revenue sources (payments vs items + freight)
2. Order status filtering differences
3. Multi-item orders inflating item-based revenue
4. Inclusion of freight in Growth but not Finance
